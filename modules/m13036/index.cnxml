graphical programming package for digital signal processing that
will be used for: data acquisition, time domain data display,
frequency domain calculation and display, filter implementation,
convolution and correlation calculations, speech/signal modeling,
and real-time filtering. Using LabVIEW DSP Module in conjunction
with the LabVIEW Digital Filter Design Toolkit, the DSP board and
the rest of the lab equipment will not only allow students to
perform data acquisition, analysis, and filtering, it will also
give them the ability to listen to the filtered output.</para>

<list list-type="bulleted" id="id10847977"><item>Log on to the computer</item>
<item>Connect a USB cable between the PC USB Port of the SPEEDY-33
(Figure 2 #7) and the USB port of your PC. The SPEEDY-33 is powered
by the USB port. Once you connect the cable, the green Power LED
(Figure 2 #2) on the SPEEDY-33 will light.</item>
<item>Confirm that the Power LED on the SPEEDY-33 is lit.</item>
<item>If the New Hardware Found Wizard starts, follow the
instructions to configure the drivers.</item>
<item>Connect your headphones to the black 3-pronged headphone
booster and connect this booster to the Audio Stereo Output Port
(Figure 2 #4) on the SPEEDY-33. Turn on the headphone volume
booster.</item>
<item>Connect the light gray cable coming out of the computer
(which is the audio output from the computer sound card) to the
short gray male-male adapter cable and connect this, in turn, to
the Audio Stereo Input Port (Figure 2 #3) of the SPEEDY-33. The
soundcard output (either CD audio or microphone) will be the input
to the DSP board for most of this lab.</item>
<item>Switch the Jumpers on the SPEEDY-33 to the Line position.
Refer to Figure 1 for the location of the Line/Microphone Jumpers
(Figure 2 #9).</item>

<list list-type="bulleted" id="id14314052"><item>Plug the A/C adapter into the DSP board and make sure that
the power LED is lit.</item>
<item>Connect your headphones to the black 3-pronged headphone
booster and connect this booster to the OUT jack on the audio
daughter card attached to the DSP board. Do not use the OUT jack
directly on the DSP board. Turn on the headphone volume
booster.</item>
<item>Connect the light gray cable coming out of the computer
(which is the audio output from the computer sound card) to the
short gray male-male adapter cable and connect this, in turn, to
the IN jack of the audio daughter card. Do not use the IN jack
directly on the DSP board. The soundcard output (either CD audio or
microphone) will be the input to the DSP board for most of this
lab.</item>
<item>Log on to the computer.</item>
<item>Once you log on, a DSK Init window should appear on the task
bar. Click on it to open up the window and then press ENTER as
often as needed to complete the initialization. This configures the
parallel port of the computer to communicate with the DSP board.
Note: If you forgot to supply power to the DSP board prior to this
step, the initialization will fail. In which case, you will have to
log off, power up the DSP board, and then log on again and run the
initialization routine again.</item>
<item>Select the EE 453 folder and create a folder within this
folder to store your lab files. Use some descriptive name to
identify your lab group. The path for this folder will be
Desktop\ee 453\&lt;folder name&gt;</item>
<item>Activate Surround Mixer, a program which controls the
input/output operation of the sound card. The Surround Mixer
control panel is a mixer consisting of numerous volume bars, each
controlling a different aspect of the sound card. The far left
volume bar controls the master volume. Make sure that the master
volume is set to 100%. The volume bars in the middle control the
various types of sound sources that the sound card can play (wave
files, microphone input, MIDI input, music CD input, etc). Make
sure that the wav/mp3, microphone, and line-in volumes are set to
100%.</item>
<item>Beneath each of the volume bars is a mute box that can be
toggled on/off. When checked, the corresponding sound source is
deactivated. Make sure that all source buttons are muted for
now.</item>
<item>Keep the Surround Mixer open throughout the lab. You will be
selecting various inputs (wave, microphone, and line-in) throughout
the lab.</item>
